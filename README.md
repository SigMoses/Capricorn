# Capricorn AI

Deep-learning based histopathology image classifier built with TensorFlow Keras.

## Overview

Capricorn AI provides pre-trained Keras models for classifying H\&Eâ€“stained tissue patches into diagnostic categories. It offers a simple Python API to load different model versions, run inference on images, and integrate into larger pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/capricorn-ai.git
cd capricorn-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install as a package
pip install .
```

Alternatively, install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/your-org/capricorn-ai.git
```

## Quickstart

```python
from capricorn_ai import list_models, load_model, load_image, predict

# List available models
print(list_models())  # ['capricorn0.1']

# Load an image
img = load_image('path/to/slide_patch.png')

# Run prediction
detections = predict('capricorn0.1', img)
print(detections)
```

## Example Usage

```python
from capricorn_ai import load_image, predict, ALL_LABELS, label_confidences

# Load and preprocess an image patch
img = load_image("path/to/patch.png")

# Run inference (returns shape (1, NUM_CLASSES))
probs = predict("capricorn0.1", img)[0]

# Print all label confidences in descending order
for label, confidence in label_confidences(probs):
    print(f"{label:30s} {confidence*100:5.1f}%")
```

## Available Models

* **capricorn0.1**: Initial version trained on PathMNIST subsets.

*Add your own retrained models by placing the `.keras` file in `models/` and updating `Capricorn_AI/models.py`.*

## Development & Testing

* Dependencies are in `requirements.txt`.
* Run tests with:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
